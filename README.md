# MavenTelecomProject
This project was created by Maven Analytics as their Maven Churn Challenge.
It is based off of a fictional dataset created by Maven Analytics containing customer churn data from a Telecommunications company.
The dataset inludes information on 7,043 customers from a Telecommunications company in California in Q2 2022.
For this challenge, I assumed the role of a BI Consultant for Maven Communications.
I have been hired to help the company improve retention by identifying high value customers and churn risks,
and have been asked to present my findings to the CMO in the form of a single page report or dashboard.
